# 🖥️ Task Manager Client (Frontend)

This is the **Client-Side** interface for the Task Manager application. It is built using **Plain HTML and Vanilla JavaScript** with no CSS framework, keeping it lightweight and simple.

It connects to a separate **Laravel/PostgreSQL Backend**.

## 🤝 Challenges for Visitors
This frontend is intentionally basic. It reads and writes data to the API.
**Want to practice?**
1.  Add a CSS Framework like Tailwind or Bootstrap to make it look good.
2.  Add "Delete" buttons to the tasks (The API supports it!).
3.  Add an "Edit" feature to change task names.
